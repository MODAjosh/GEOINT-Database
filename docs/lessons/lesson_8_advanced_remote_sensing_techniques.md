# Lesson 8: Advanced Remote Sensing Techniques with Drones

## Overview

This lesson will dive deeper into **advanced remote sensing techniques** that are specifically enabled by drone technology. While drones have many practical uses in capturing basic imagery, their advanced sensors enable us to gather detailed environmental, agricultural, and urban data that were once difficult or costly to acquire.

In this lesson, students will learn how to harness the power of drone-mounted **multispectral sensors**, **LiDAR**, and **thermal imaging** to collect advanced data for specialized applications such as vegetation analysis, 3D terrain modeling, and temperature monitoring.

## Advanced Remote Sensing Technologies

### 1. **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**

**LiDAR** technology uses laser pulses to measure distances to the Earth's surface. LiDAR-equipped drones can create high-resolution **3D models** of terrains, vegetation, and urban areas. Unlike traditional photogrammetry, LiDAR doesn't rely on sunlight, and it can penetrate dense vegetation to map the ground surface below.

#### Applications:
   - **Topographic Mapping**: Generating highly accurate elevation data for flood modeling, land use planning, and geological surveys.
   - **Forestry**: Measuring tree height, canopy density, and biomass.
   - **Urban Planning**: Mapping urban areas, including building heights, infrastructure, and road networks.

#### Key Drone with LiDAR:
   - **DJI Matrice 350 RTK with L2 LiDAR**: A high-precision drone for LiDAR data collection in complex environments.

#### Key Software for LiDAR Processing:
   - **LAStools**
   - **CloudCompare**
   - **FUSION**

### 2. **Multispectral and Hyperspectral Sensing**

Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors capture data in multiple wavelength bands, including visible and non-visible light. While multispectral sensors typically measure 4 to 6 bands (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infrared), hyperspectral sensors capture hundreds of bands, providing more detailed spectral data.

#### Applications:
   - **Agriculture**: Using **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** to assess plant health.
   - **Environmental Monitoring**: Identifying vegetation types, monitoring water bodies, and detecting land use changes.
   - **Disaster Management**: Analyzing damage after wildfires, floods, or storms.

#### Key Drone with Multispectral/Hyperspectral Sensors:
   - **Parrot Sequoia**: A multispectral sensor for agricultural monitoring.
   - **Sentera**: A sensor capable of multispectral imaging for crop health and other environmental analyses.

#### Key Software for Multispectral Processing:
   - **QGIS with the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) plugin**
   - **Pix4Dfields**: A specialized software for agricultural remote sensing analysis.

### 3. **Thermal Imaging**

**Thermal cameras** capture infrared radiation emitted by objects based on their temperature. These sensors can provide insight into temperature variations across the landscape, such as heat loss in buildings or the health of vegetation, which may not be visible in standard RGB imagery.

#### Applications:
   - **Building Inspections**: Identifying heat loss or faulty insulation.
   - **Energy Audits**: Detecting energy inefficiencies in buildings or infrastructure.
   - **Wildlife Monitoring**: Detecting animals at night based on their heat signature.
   - **Search and Rescue**: Locating missing persons or assessing emergency situations based on temperature differences.

#### Key Drone with Thermal Imaging:
   - **DJI Zenmuse XT2**: A dual-sensor camera combining visible and thermal imaging for inspections and monitoring.

#### Key Software for Thermal Image Processing:
   - **FLIR Tools**
   - **QGIS** with thermal layers

### Drone Flight Planning for Remote Sensing

To collect effective data using advanced sensors, careful **flight planning** is crucial. Proper planning helps ensure full coverage of the area and optimal sensor performance. Key considerations include:

- **Altitude and Overlap**: Different sensors require specific flight altitudes and image overlaps to ensure accurate data capture.
- **Weather and Lighting Conditions**: The time of day, weather, and light conditions can significantly affect sensor performance (e.g., LiDAR is less affected by lighting than optical sensors).
- **Flight Path**: Ensure that the flight path is optimized for complete coverage of the survey area, especially for complex data types like LiDAR and multispectral sensors.

### Data Processing and Analysis

Once the drone collects the data, **data processing** is required to convert raw data into actionable insights. For example:

- **LiDAR Data**: Process LiDAR data to create **digital elevation models (DEMs)**, **contour maps**, and **3D point clouds**. Software like **LAStools** or **CloudCompare** will help filter and classify LiDAR point clouds for precise terrain modeling.
- **Multispectral Data**: Use tools like **QGIS** or **Pix4D** to process multispectral images and calculate vegetation indices like **NDVI** for crop health or land use analysis.
- **Thermal Data**: Use software like **FLIR Tools** or **QGIS** to visualize temperature variations across the landscape and identify areas of concern, such as inefficient insulation or active wildfires.

### Hands-On Activities

#### 1. **LiDAR Data Processing**
- Task: Collect LiDAR data over a forested area or urban landscape.
- Process the data using **LAStools** or **CloudCompare** to create a 3D model of the terrain.
- Analyze the data for features such as tree canopy height, slope, and building heights.

#### 2. **Multispectral Analysis for Vegetation Health**
- Task: Use a drone with a multispectral sensor (like **Parrot Sequoia**) to collect imagery of a crop field.
- Process the data using **QGIS** and calculate the **NDVI** to assess plant health.
- Analyze the NDVI map to determine areas that may need additional irrigation or fertilizers.

#### 3. **Thermal Imaging for Building Inspections**
- Task: Use a drone with a thermal camera (like **DJI Zenmuse XT2**) to inspect the exterior of a building.
- Process the thermal imagery using **FLIR Tools** to identify areas of heat loss or structural inefficiencies.
