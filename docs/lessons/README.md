# Lesson 1: Introduction to GEOINT

## What is GEOINT?
Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) is the use of geospatial data to gain insights and make decisions. This data can be collected from satellite imagery, drone surveys, and other remote sensing technologies.

### Tools Used:
- GIS software (QGIS)
- Python (GeoPandas, Rasterio)
- Satellite data sources (Sentinel, Landsat)

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the importance of GEOINT in various fields (e.g., defense, environmental monitoring, urban planning).
- Learn about the data sources used for GEOINT.
- Gain familiarity with tools and workflows used in GEOINT.
