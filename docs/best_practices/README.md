## **Example Best Practice: Handling Missing Data**

### **Strategies for Dealing with Missing Data:**
1. **Imputation**  
   - Estimate missing values using statistical or geospatial interpolation methods. Examples include mean imputation, kriging, or inverse distance weighting.  
   - Ensure that the chosen method is appropriate for the dataset and does not introduce significant bias.

2. **Exclusion**  
   - Remove records with missing data if the missing values are minimal and their exclusion does not compromise the integrity of the analysis.  
   - Clearly document any exclusions and justify their impact on the results.
