# **Processed Geospatial Data**

This directory contains pre-processed and cleaned geospatial data, ready for analysis. The datasets here have undergone necessary transformations to ensure they are consistent, usable, and aligned with analytical workflows.

## **Contents of the Directory**
### **Datasets Included**
1. **Urban Heat Island Analysis**  
   Processed temperature data and associated geospatial features, prepared for urban climate studies.
2. **Topographic Maps**  
   Cleaned and processed topographic map data, aligned with other geospatial layers for ease of integration.

## **Example Data Files**
| **File Name**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `urban_heat_islands_2021.geojson` | GeoJSON file containing urban heat island study results, derived from raw thermal imagery. |
| `topographic_map_2020.shp`   | Shapefile with topographic features, such as rivers, roads, and elevation contours. |

## **Important Notes**
- **Ready for Analysis**: Processed datasets are formatted and cleaned, simplifying their integration into analytical workflows.  
- **Simplifications and Assumptions**: During preprocessing, some generalizations or assumptions may have been applied. Be mindful of this when interpreting the data.  
- **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)**: Ensure that all datasets use a consistent projection and CRS for seamless spatial analysis.

## **Adding New Processed Data**
1. **Process Raw Data**: Clean and transform datasets as needed using appropriate geospatial tools.  
2. **Upload to This Directory**: Save the processed datasets here with clear and descriptive filenames.  
3. **Update Metadata**: Add or update metadata for each processed dataset in the `/metadata/` directory. Be sure to document:  
   - Processing steps taken (e.g., reprojection, clipping, cleaning).  
   - Any assumptions or transformations applied.  
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Check that the projection and CRS align with existing datasets in the directory.
